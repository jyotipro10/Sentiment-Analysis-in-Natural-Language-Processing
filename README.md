# Sentiment-Analysis-in-Natural-Language-Processing
## This was my summer project under Dr. Prosenjit Gupta in Elahe Technologies. (May'20 - Jul'20)

In the learning phase, we have learnt about Python programming language along with various
libraries of python programming language. After that, we moved towards Natural Language
Processing learning about various language models as well as libraries of NLP.
In the last phase of work, we have performed sentiment analysis on a IMDb movie review dataset
available on internet and wrote a model that was applied on test dataset which predicts the
output with ~89% accuracy.
These are the steps for building the final project model :
1. Performed sentiment analysis on 25000 movie reviews and trained our model to predict on new
dataset.
2. Preprocessed the raw dataset using tokenizer and Porter Stemmer and also removed the stop
words.
3. Vectorized the dataset using Tf-Idf vectorizer to vectorize the whole dataset into a feature vector.
4. Trained the model using Logistic Regression CV classifier and Multinomial Naive Bayes with 70-30
train-test ratio on non-skewed data set and compare the two models using accuracy.
